# MC Auto Translation Tool

**MC Auto Translation Tool** is a charity-driven, open-source, client-only full-interface translation mod
for Minecraft Java Edition. The server does not need the mod; it translates player-visible text such as
chat, quest books, mod menus, scoreboards, item descriptions, and signs.

> See [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/wuxiangdan96-byte/mc-auto-translation-tool/releases/latest) for the
> current stable version and publication date. Use only the JAR matching your Minecraft version and mod loader.

## Why use it

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Full-interface translation | Covers chat, quest and recipe screens, mod menus, scoreboards, Tab, titles, boss bars, containers, item names and lore, books, signs, holograms, and more |
| Client-only | Minecraft servers do not need the mod and receive no extra mod network packets |
| Local offline mode | The recommended built-in mode requires no API key; its model and translation content remain on the user's computer |
| Multiple providers | Built-in Chinese MT and LLM services, plus LibreTranslate, OpenAI-compatible, and custom HTTP JSON APIs |
| Responsive and resilient | Translation runs in the background; unfinished requests and service failures keep the original text without blocking rendering |
| Privacy protection | Player names are separated locally by default and can be translated only when explicitly enabled; server addresses, URLs, numbers, and formatting codes remain protected |
| Blocked keywords | Custom skip-translation keywords; matching text stays original and is never sent to the offline model or an online API |
| Local cache | Coalesces identical requests and caches translations to reduce latency and remote-service costs |
| Optional outgoing translation | Can translate normal chat and send it in order; this is off by default and commands always remain unchanged |

## Quick start

1. Check the **Minecraft version, mod loader, and Java version** used by the game instance.
2. Open the [latest release](https://github.com/wuxiangdan96-byte/mc-auto-translation-tool/releases/latest) and select a JAR from the table below.
3. Remove 1.3.6 and every older copy from that instance's `mods` folder, then add exactly one matching 1.3.7 JAR. Fabric also requires the matching version of Fabric API.
4. Start the game. Press `F8` to toggle automatic translation; press `U` to open settings. If Mod Menu is installed, the same settings screen is also available from the mods list.
5. For a first run, choose **Offline** and **Translated only**. See the [installation and usage guide](USER_GUIDE.md) for details.

Fabric, Forge, and NeoForge all open the graphical settings with `U`, including blocked keywords
and the player-name switch. Fabric instances with Mod Menu can also open that same screen from
the mods list. Tencent credentials and other advanced provider keys can still be
edited in `config/universal-translator.properties`.

## Downloads and version selection

The stable release turns 30 release build artifacts into **15 directly installable JARs**. Fabric uses
one all-version JAR whose embedded implementation is selected by Loader. Forge shares a JAR only between
adjacent versions with verified compatibility.
The source tree also contains Ornithe legacy bundles and early Fabric targets without a complete translation
pipeline. Those targets are not packed into the current GitHub stable download; do not use the v1.3.7
`fabric-all` JAR on a game version that is not
listed as included.

The table links directly to every JAR in the current stable release and lists source-validated
targets that are not yet shipped with v1.3.7. These links are updated with the README whenever a
new stable version is published:

## Translation methods and privacy

| Method | API key required | Text leaves the computer | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Offline Lite / Quality | No | No | Recommended; downloads the platform engine and selected model on first use |
| Local LibreTranslate | Depends on service | No | Users already running LibreTranslate locally |
| Remote LibreTranslate | Depends on service | Yes | A trusted HTTPS translation service |
| Local OpenAI-compatible API | Depends on service | No | A user-run compatible service such as llama.cpp or Ollama |
| Online OpenAI-compatible API | Usually | Yes | A user-selected HTTPS LLM service |
| Dedicated MT / LLM APIs | Usually | Yes | Baidu, Tencent Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Youdao, Volcengine, iFlytek, Huawei Cloud, DeepSeek, Qwen, Zhipu, and others |
| Custom HTTP JSON API | Depends on service | Depends on endpoint | User-defined safe request templates, authentication headers, and nested response paths |
| Tencent-compatible interface | Yes | Yes | Legacy configuration compatibility only |

- Offline mode runs only on a loopback address; server, mod, and modpack text is not sent to the project.
- With a remote API, visible text allowed for translation is sent to the user-configured service. The project does not hold API keys.
- API keys are stored only in the current game instance's configuration file. Remote endpoints must use HTTPS.
- Chat content, other interfaces, and player-initiated outgoing translation can be disabled separately. Outgoing translation is off by default.
- Cache keys use SHA-256; original text is not written to the cache file in plaintext.
- Blocked keywords keep matching text on the local computer; it is never sent to a translation service.

See [online API configuration](ONLINE_APIS.md) for built-in services and custom requests, and the
[installation and usage guide](USER_GUIDE.md) for other settings, model downloads, and troubleshooting.

## Current validation status

Every target in the current stable release passes a clean build, shared-core self-tests, Mixin/refmap checks,
runtime mapping checks, release-structure validation, and SHA-256 verification. The all-version Fabric JAR
contains 19 exact implementations and passes real Loader selection tests for every target. NeoForge 1.20.1
has also completed a real client launch and mod initialization.

“Builds successfully” does not mean “completed an in-server manual regression.” Build, launch, and manual
validation levels are recorded separately in the [compatibility matrix](COMPATIBILITY.md).
