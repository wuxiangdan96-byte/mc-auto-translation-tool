This document records only completed validation. “Builds successfully” is not reported as
“compatible.”

## Offline startup and runtime fixes added in 1.3.6

- Compatibility mode no longer repeats newer optional switches after the first offline-engine startup failure, allowing launcher-cached older llama.cpp builds to start.
- Startup exits, timeouts, permissions, missing files, unsupported CPU instructions, and memory-pressure termination now produce focused diagnostics using only the current attempt's appended log output.
- The 1.21.x Forge and NeoForge release targets are validated on Java 21. Do not substitute Java 25: an older LWJGL native layer may terminate before a Java stack trace can be produced.
- Remove 1.3.6 and every older copy from the `mods` directory when updating; keep exactly one 1.3.7 JAR matching the game version and loader.

## Settings selection fix added in 1.3.5

- Custom settings text now always uses explicit opaque ARGB colors, so provider names and the
  selected provider remain visible on Minecraft versions that honor the alpha byte.
- A source validation task rejects six-digit transparent text colors in every settings selection
  implementation shared by the published Fabric, Forge, and NeoForge targets.

## Offline runtime and interface fixes added in 1.3.4

- When a Windows game directory contains Chinese or other non-ASCII characters, the verified GGUF
  model is exposed to the native engine through a same-volume hard link, with a one-time compatibility
  copy fallback, so llama.cpp does not receive a mojibake model path.
- Android ARM64 Java launchers are no longer mistaken for Ubuntu ARM64. They select the checksum-pinned
  official Android ARM64 build from the same llama.cpp release, and install the executable engine in
  private app storage instead of a shared-storage `noexec` mount.
- Path handling, platform selection, and native library lookup are covered by the shared core tests.
  Full Android in-game results still depend on launcher permissions, Android version, and available RAM.

The stable release starts from 30 formally shipped target JARs that share the same translation core
and reduces them to 15 directly installable release JARs. Additional adjacent-version source targets
are build-tested separately and are not counted as stable downloads. Fabric 1.20.1 completed Loom remapping.
The Forge 1.20.1 artifact was renamed into the SRG runtime namespace and contains a refmap for all
nine Mixin classes. Forge 1.21.11 was adapted to the Forge 7 event bus and Mojmap runtime. Its
development client initialized the 1.3.4 mod and completed resource, audio, and atlas reload before
the automated session was stopped; a full manual in-server regression remains pending.

The 1.3.4 provider factory, custom JSON templates, nested response paths, signing digests, endpoint
and header safety, bounded retries, and configuration migration passed core tests without real keys or
external traffic. End-to-end provider calls still require a user's own account, quota, and region, so
this table does not describe local protocol tests as successful calls to paid APIs.

The single 1.21.x JAR embeds twelve exact-version implementations rather than widening one Mixin
build across incompatible game APIs. Each nested implementation declares one Minecraft version,
and Fabric Loader selects the exact match for 1.21, 1.21.1, 1.21.2, 1.21.3, 1.21.4, 1.21.5,
1.21.6, 1.21.7, 1.21.8, 1.21.9, 1.21.10, or 1.21.11.

Every loader metadata file is pinned to the exact Minecraft version that passed build validation.
Pending launch and in-server checks remain explicitly marked and are never used to guess adjacent-version compatibility.

## The principle behind “support every version”

Minecraft generations use different loaders, Java versions, rendering APIs, and text-component
structures. One JAR cannot safely cover every Java Edition version. The project adapts
representative, long-lived versions individually and keeps a separate JAR for each release line.
A target enters the verified table only after build, launch, and in-server interface regression.

Planned candidates, in order:

1. 1.12.2 Cleanroom;
2. 1.7.10 Forge;
3. 1.16.5 Forge;
4. 1.18.2 Forge/Fabric;
5. 1.21.1 Fabric/NeoForge;
6. later releases that retain a substantial player base.

“Nearby version” support is never guessed by widening the version range in `fabric.mod.json` or
`mods.toml`. For example, the 1.20.1 JAR intentionally rejects 1.20.2, and Fabric and Forge JARs
are never interchangeable. Small descriptor or event-ABI changes can otherwise turn into startup
Mixin failures. Adjacent versions may reuse the shared core, but each needs a platform adapter and
the same build, mapping, launch, and in-server checks before being listed as supported.

## In-server regression checklist

- chat, scoreboard, Tab list, Action Bar, titles, and Boss Bar;
- chest/menu titles, item names and Lore, signs, books, entity names, and holographic text;
- mod settings, quest books, recipe screens, and custom modpack title screens before joining a world;
- mod/modpack text rendered through Minecraft's font is captured, while image text and custom renderers remain explicit limitations;
- text entered and sent by the player remains unchanged;
- online and local player names remain unchanged by default, and the player-name translation toggle works; server IP/domain/port always remain unchanged;
- existing Chinese is not translated again, while English fragments can be translated;
- translated-only mode does not overflow with bilingual text, and color options work;
- the `U` control panel and `F8` master toggle work at different window sizes;
- the game stays responsive and keeps the original text while a model downloads or when a download or offline engine fails.
